# hello-world
This repository is to get a refresher on the GitHub flow for Code Louisville
I live in Louisville and recently had a son. Taking on parenthood has been really fun, but when I get the chance I love exercising and gaming.
I have had some experience with programming through the Odin Project and freeCodeCamp on my own, but I do look forward to having others around to help each other and push one another as well.
